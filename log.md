# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished up FCC tutorials on NodeJS and ExpressJS. Watched more of Wes Bos' ES6 for Everyone. Started yummy-timestamps on Cloud9.

**Thoughts**: After committing to the 100 days of code challenege, I decided to think of some projects I wanted to do. I have been using FreeCodeCamp to fill in knowledge gaps. I will also be recording the tutorials I watch since I want to keep a record of those, but they will not count toward my one hour each day. I have decided to focus on a lot of their projects to help build real things, starting with the Backend Service projects. I will also be working along with Adam Watham's Test-Driven Laravel. The larger projects I want to work on are Servant Heart (a service ministry management platform for churches) and a lightweight meal planning web app.

### Day 1: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished up Wes Bos' ES6 for Everyone. Set up the environment for using ExpressJS on my local machine and did more work on YT, hoping to get it finished up tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I have learned a ton from ES6 for Everyone, I highly recommend it. Understanding the tooling for getting ExpressJS up and running, and getting a nice build/commit process and a deployment to Heroky set up for Yummy Timestamps took a large majority of my time, since I have never done that before. But I feel more confident in handling that and will be able to easily add services in the future.

### Day 2: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished the functional code part for Yummy Timestamps. Works like a dream 👍

**Thoughts**: It took a little over an hour to get the Timestamp microservice up and running. I feel weird about doing so much logic inside the Route closure, and if this was a larger project I'd probably separate that from the server.js file. I don't like working with dates, but I'm glad I figured this one out. Shout out to the dateformat library on NPM, that's a lifesaver.

### Day 3: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the front end of Yummy Timestamps, and marked that project complete in Free Code Camp! Also watched more of Wes Bos' React for Beginner series.

**Thoughts**: I got to implement some Flexbox, very little but it's the first time I've really worked with it. Pretty slow day, CSS definitely isn't my strong suit. But that's the point of these exercises!

### Day 4: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Request Headers FCC challenge and started working on the next FCC challenge, a URL Shortener. Tomorrow looks like a dive into Mongo.

**Thoughts**: Did some good work with Request Headers today. Because there's so many different types, I had always been reticient about using them. This challenge helped quell some of that fear. I also started working on using MongoDB with my next FCC challenge, a URL Shortener. I'm looking forward to working with DBs more.

### Day 5: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent all of my time figuring out how to use MongoDB from within an Express JS app.

**Thoughts**: It took a while, but I finally figured out some basics for working with MongoDB on my URL Shortener. MLab is a lifesaver. Tomorrow I'm going to be shooting for starting on the actual user stories for the challenge.

### Day 6: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on Wes Bos' React for Beginners course. Applied the Firebase learning to the URL shortener.

**Thoughts**: I wanted to compare implementation of Firebase and MongoDB to see which I would like better.

### Day 7: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on Wes Bos' React for Beginners course and worked through some Video Challenges at FreeCodeCamp.com.

**Thoughts**: I was so caught up in finishing tutorials today, but ran out of free time to actually write code. Tomorrow morning, I'll start working on the URL Shortener once more!

### Day 8: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on Wes Bos' React for Beginners course and worked through some Video Challenges at FreeCodeCamp.com.

**Thoughts**: An addendum I'm adding to the rules, while I work through these tutorials (I work better when I don't have large gaps in completing tutorials), is to allow them in my hour of code. Most of my time was spent researching and Firebase vs Mongo.

### Day 9: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Wes Bos' React for Beginners, and started in on the first few videos of his Redux series. Spent the entire hour figuring out why ESLint kept crashing in my project.

**Thoughts**: Killer tutorials again by Wes Bos. I spent a frustrating hour trying to figure out why ESLint was not pulling in the HTML plugin correctly. Still don't have a clear solution, but I did get a nice exercise in googling around and following different troubleshooting methods. I guess you need a few days like that.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished up FCC tutorials on NodeJS and ExpressJS. Watched more of Wes Bos' ES6 for Everyone. Started yummy-timestamps on Cloud9.

**Thoughts**: After committing to the 100 days of code challenege, I decided to think of some projects I wanted to do. I have been using FreeCodeCamp to fill in knowledge gaps. I will also be recording the tutorials I watch since I want to keep a record of those, but they will not count toward my one hour each day. I have decided to focus on a lot of their projects to help build real things, starting with the Backend Service projects. I will also be working along with Adam Watham's Test-Driven Laravel. The larger projects I want to work on are Servant Heart (a service ministry management platform for churches) and a lightweight meal planning web app.

### Day 1: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Finished up Wes Bos' ES6 for Everyone. Set up the environment for using ExpressJS on my local machine and did more work on YT, hoping to get it finished up tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I have learned a ton from ES6 for Everyone, I highly recommend it. Understanding the tooling for getting ExpressJS up and running, and getting a nice build/commit process and a deployment to Heroky set up for Yummy Timestamps took a large majority of my time, since I have never done that before. But I feel more confident in handling that and will be able to easily add services in the future.
